Welcome to Bushfire Attack Level Toolbox's documentation!
=========================================================

Overview
--------

This toolbox is used to compute the Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) for an
area of interest within Australia based on the input vegetation and
elevation datasets.

The computation algorithm is adapted spatially to Method 1 in the
Australian Standard AS 3959 (2009)--*Construction of buildings in
bushfire-prone areas*.
