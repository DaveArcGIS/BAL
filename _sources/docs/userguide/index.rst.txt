This part is extracted from the source code in-line documentation and
included in this document for the completeness of the software
package. It does not directly instruct users how to use the toolbox to
calculate the BAL. Instead, it might be useful for software engineers
or developers to review the source code and maintain or upgrade it in
the future.
