About Geoscience Australia
--------------------------

Geoscience Australia is the geoscience advisor to the Australian
Government on matters of national importance, and custodian of the
geographical and geological data and knowledge of the nation.

By understanding the geological history and geospatial aspects of our
continent, we build our knowledge and capability to prepare us for the
future.

We deliver a wide range of products that address important and
significant national issues to assist government and the community to
make informed decisions about the use of natural resources, the
management of the environment, and community safety.

Through six key strategic priority areas, Geoscience Australia
provides applied research and information for the Australian community
to obtain sustainable economic, social and environmental benefits.

* Building Australia's Resource Wealth
* Ensuring Australia's Community Safety
* Securing Australia's Water Resources
* Managing Australia's Marine Jurisdictions
* Providing Fundamental Geographic Information
* Maintaining Geoscience Knowledge and Capability

We apply our geoscience knowledge and capability to acquire, store and
manage Australia's national fundamental geological and geographic
information.

This enables Australia to make critical decisions regarding our
natural resource potential and marine environment, and helps to build
our resilience to natural hazards.

It also ensures sustainable Australian communities by managing our
precious water resources.

Geoscience Australia continues to actively promote Australia's mineral
and energy resources to international trade partners, increasing
awareness of the opportunities Australia's vast resource sector
provides.

Working with our government partner organisations, we have broadened
our scope of work in support of Australia's efforts to reduce the
impact of natural disasters in our region.

In Australia we are exposed to many hazards - fires, floods,
earthquakes, tsunamis, and extreme weather. These natural events
transform into natural disasters when lives are lost, and property is
destroyed. Geoscience Australia understands these hazards and the
risks they pose to communities.

As our population grows, people and infrastructure become exposed to
hazards. It is not enough to simply respond, we must prepare.

To protect the vulnerable we must understand the risks they face and
managing the impact of natural hazards to avoid disaster.

**How do we ensure Australia's community safety?**

We must recognise the worst case, to plan for the best outcome and
consider how we develop our unique landscape.  Combining short-term
response and long term planning, making decisions based on evidence
specific to Australia's circumstances.

In times of confidence and crisis, Geoscience Australia models and
measures the hazards that put us in danger.

We identify what parts of Australia are most at risk, and assesses the
potential financial and social costs facing our environment, our
industries and the people they support.

We must understand how hazards impact our society, to allow
communities to prepare for emergencies, to provide advice to prevent
emerging disasters and to build a safer and more resilient future, for
us all.

The vision for the Community Safety Branch is to develop and deliver
authoritative nationally consistent data and information to enable
decision makers, governments, businesses and the community to better
understand the consequences of hazard events and to contribute to more
resilient communities.
