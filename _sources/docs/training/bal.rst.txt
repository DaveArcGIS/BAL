What is the Bushfire Attack Level
=================================

The Bushfire Attack Level measures the **severity of a building's
potential exposure** to ember attack, radiant heat and direct flame
contact. It is intended to improve the resistance of buildings to
bushfire attack from burning embers, radiant heat, flame contact or a
combination of these. It applies to buildings sited in designated
bushfire-prone areas, as defined in the Building Code of Australia
(*ref*).

By improving the ability of buildings in bushfire-prone areas to
withstand attack from bushfire, there is an increase in the protection
afforded to building occupants (until the fire front passes) as well
as to the building itself.

However, improving the design and construction of buildings is only
one way that property owners can address the damage during a
bushfire. Other measures fall within the areas of planning,
subdivision, siting, landscaping and maintenance.

.. note:: It should be borne in mind that the measures contained in
          this Standard cannot guarantee that a building will survive
          a bushfire event on every occasion. This is substantially
          due to the degree of vegetation management, the
          unpredictable nature and behaviour of fire, and extreme
          weather conditions (AS 3959--2009). 

The bushfire attack level is a measure of the severity of a building's
potential exposure to ember attack, radiant heat and direct flame
contact, using increments of radiant heat expressed in kilowatts per
metre squared. When calculated, the |project_name| toolbox provides
classified levels:

* BAL--LOW
* BAL--12.5
* BAL--19
* BAL--29
* BAL--40
* BAL--FZ

Appendix G in AS 3959--2009 describes the threats associated with each BAL.

How do we determine BAL
=======================

The |project_name| toolbox applies Method 1 from AS 3959--2009 to
determine the BAL. Method 1 is a simplified procedure to determine the
BAL, which involves five steps. This method is subject to limitations
on the circumstances in which it can be used.

.. warning:: This method is not valid where the effective slope under the 
             classified vegetation is more than 20 degrees downslope. Within 
             the BAL toolbox, where the slope is greater than 20 degrees, a 
             constant value of 200 is used for the BAL.

There are five steps in determining the BAL based on method 1 in AS 3959--2009. 

Step 1: Determine the relevant FDI

Step 2: Determine the classified vegetation type(s)

Step 3: Determine the distance of the site from the classified vegetation type(s)

Step 4: Determine the effective slope(s) under teh classified vegetation type(s)

Step 5: Determine the BAL from the appropriate table

.. note:: AS 3959-2009 includes a sixth step, which refers to
          construction requirements. This is not of interest in the
          BAL toolbox, so is omitted here.
