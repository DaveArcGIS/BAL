The initial development of the Bushfire Attack Level toolbox was 
supported by the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre (2010-2014), 
under the Fire Impact and Risk Evaluation Decision Support Toolbox 
(FireDST) project. Translation to an ArcGIS Toolbox was sponsored 
by the Department of Fire and Emergency Services, Western Australia
